Compulsive internment Compulsive internment consists of internment against the patient's own will.\n\nTo practice this type of internment, a court order signed with a psychiatric report is required, reporting that the patient represents a danger to himself and to those who surround you.\n\nIn the Clinic, **we do not accept compulsory hospitalizations**. We believe that the individual needs to have a free will to undergo treatment, and therefore, through a conversation with the patient we try to appeal to common sense and convince him to undergo treatment at the Clinic. https://www.clinicaolhosdeagua.pt/faqs [] false [] 7
